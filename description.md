# Project

I need a way to manage my web links/bookmarks across machines. I am not able to use the browser's bookmarks and have them transferred across machines.

Essentially, I cannot use this: (Chrome's bookmarks)[https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop]


## Why cannot I not use it?
My company prohibits personal logins via chrome. I could create a company account but I do not want another account. Also, I want to be able to 
sync links from one account to another.
